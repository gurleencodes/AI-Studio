AI-Studio Summary 
--> (to be added after final presentation – Dec 6th)
--> Performed data cleaning and feature engineering on IRS and demographic datasets.
--> Developed a custom ZIP-code–level Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), providing a more granular alternative to the county-level SVI available from SDS.
--> Created an interactive vulnerability map for New York State, featuring:
--> Categorization of ZIP codes into low, moderate, high, and severe vulnerability tiers.
--> Tooltip functionality displaying ZIP code, computed SVI score, and associated feature metrics.
--> Implemented K-means clustering to group ZIP codes by vulnerability-related characteristics, with an adjustable slider for selecting the number of clusters.

Goal: Build a predictive model that classifies ZIP codes as healthcare deserts vs. non-deserts, using the custom SVI, demographic indicators, and clustering insights to support targeted intervention and planning.
